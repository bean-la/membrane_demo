# Membrane Speech To Text demo

This is a [Livebook](https://livebook.dev) example, that shows how to perform a real-time speech-to-text conversion with the use of the [Membrane Framework](https://github.com/membraneframework) and the [Bumblebee](https://github.com/elixir-nx/bumblebee).

To run the demo, [install Livebook](https://livebook.dev/#install) and open the `speech_to_text.livemd` file there.
If you're using Livebook Desktop, you can also [click here](https://livebook.dev/run?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmembraneframework%2Fmembrane_demo%2Fmaster%2Fspeech_to_text%2Fspeech_to_text.livemd) instead.
